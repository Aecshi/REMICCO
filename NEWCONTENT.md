I. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The Responsible and Empowered Mindoreños Credit Cooperative was organized in
2018 through the initiative and aspiration of Fr. Jimson H. Ruga, the Chairman of the
Board of Saklaw Foundation, Inc. A Microfinance NGO) who was instrumental in the
formation of a non-government organization in Oriental Mindoro. Due to his
persistence, he was able to convince the Board of Trustees of Saklaw Foundation, to
organize a cooperative for the employees of the institution.  With these efforts, the
REMICCO was formally organized; the Board of Trustees and employees have
voluntarily contributed for the paid-up capital stock and fortunately was able to gather
₱711,000.00 as a starting paid up capital. 
The positive support from BOT and employees inspired the volunteer organizers to start
establishing a cooperative; eventually on February 03, 2018 a Pre-registration Seminar
was held at St. Augustine Seminary attended by seventy-nine 79 participants.
From here, the quorum agreed to have interim officers to be elected to start the ball
rolling. Most of the core leaders came from Saklaw Foundation, Inc. Elected Board of
Directors to lead the cooperative was as follows:
a. Fr. Jimson H. Ruga
b. Beverlie C. Panganiban
c. Marjorie R. Mendoza, CPA
d. Dr. Iluminada M. Martin
e. Nestor C. Salvacion
Appointed as Officers of the Cooperative are:
a. Fr. Jimson H. Ruga - Chairman of the Board
b. Dionisia C. Adalia – Treasurer
c. Lourdes L. Alarde – Secretary
d. Frederick R. Villanueva - Manager
Thus the Responsible and Empowered Mindoreños Credit Cooperative (REMICCO)
was born. Like any other new organization, REMICCO experienced birth pains,
considering that the standard of living is very low. 
On March 05, 2018, its officers submitted all the requirements for registration. On April
25, 2018, Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) granted and approved its
application and was duly registered to operate as a Credit Cooperative under
Registration No. 9520-104000000004304.
Ms. Lilia Buela, extended technical assistance to REMICCO as part of their mobilization
program. With her help, members and officers of the credit cooperative were able to
strengthen their knowledge on cooperativism.

On April 30, 2018, CDA issued a Certificate of Compliance. Right after receiving the

May 24, 2018.

   services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender,
   social, racial, cultural, political or religious discrimination.

   Cooperatives are democratic organizations that are controlled by their members
   who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Men and
   women serving as elected representatives, directors or officers are accountable
   to the membership. In primary cooperatives, members have equal voting rights
   of one-member, one-vote. Cooperatives at other levels are organized in the
   same democratic manner.
3. Member Economic Participation
   Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their
   cooperatives. At least part of the capital is the common property of the
   cooperative. They shall receive limited compensation or limited interest, if any,
   on capital subscribed and paid as a condition of membership. Members allocated
   surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: (1) developing the cooperative
   by setting up reserves, part of which should be at least be indivisible; benefitting
   members in proportion to their patronage of cooperative’s business; and,
   supporting other activities approved by the membership.
4. Autonomy and Independence
   Cooperatives are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by their
   members. If they enter into agreements with other organizations, including
   government, or raise capital from external sources, they shall do some terms that
   ensure democratic control of their members and maintain their cooperative
   autonomy.
5. Education, Training and Information
   Cooperatives shall provide education and training for their members, elected and
   appointed representatives, managers and employees, so that they can contribute
   effectively and efficiently to the development of their cooperatives.
6. Cooperation Among Cooperatives

off:

   the amount of loan, date of transaction, the date it was determined
   uncollectible and the uncollectible outstanding balance.

   indeed a bad debt.
